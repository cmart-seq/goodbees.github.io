I am a biologist and this is my blog for sharing analyses that inspire me but don\u0026rsquo;t neatly fit into my PhD thesis topic.\nI\u0026rsquo;m particularly interested in analyzing trends within my field (plant \u0026ldquo;-omics\u0026rdquo;), evaluating the effects of these trends on the wider world, and dissecting naturally beautiful things, literally and analytically.\nMy scientific roots are in neuroscience and genomics tool development, but I have focused on plant biology since starting my graduate work at MIT.\nI wish to share my \u0026ldquo;orchid-tinted glasses\u0026rdquo; with you, or the biologist\u0026rsquo;s perspective: a gift for appreciating the tenderness, ferocity, and brilliance of the natural world that represents billions of years of biochemical discourse.\nemail: camart = mit + edu (google scholar)[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5DolZmgAAAAJ\u0026amp;hl=en] (twitter) ",
