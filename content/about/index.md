I'm Carly Martin. I am a biologist and this is my blog for sharing analyses that inspire me but don't neatly fit into my PhD thesis topic. 

I'm particularly interested in analyzing trends within my field (plant "-omics"), evaluating the effects of these trends on the wider world, and dissecting naturally beautiful things, literally and analytically. 

My scientific roots are in neuroscience and genomics tool development, but I have focused on plant biology since starting my graduate work at MIT.
