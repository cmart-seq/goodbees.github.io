I'm Carly Martin. I'm a biologist and this is my blog for sharing analyses. 

I'm particularly interested in analyzing trends within my field (plant genomics), hypothesizing about the effects of these trends, and dissecting naturally beautiful things, literally and analytically. 

My scientific roots are in neuroscience and genomics tool development, but I have focused on plant biology since starting my graduate work at MIT.
